## Evaluate and Submit
**Remember to install the `duckietown-shell` in order to evaluate or make a submission.**
learning
You will need to copy the relevant files from the [duckietown_il/](../duckietown_il) directory to the [submission/](../submission) one. 
In particular, you will need to overwrite [submission/model.py](./model.py) to match [duckietown_il/model.py](../duckietown_il/model.py)
and place your final model inside of 
submission/tf_models/ so you can load it correctly. 
Then, you are ready to evaluate!

Either locally with
```
dts challenges evaluate
```
Or make an official submission
```
dts challengs submit
```

## Template "Imitation Learning from Simulation" for challenge [`aido_LF`][lf], [`aido_LFV`][lfv] and [`aido_LFVI`][lfvi]

This is a baseline for one of the challenges in the [the AI Driving Olympics](http://aido.duckietown.org/).

## Description

This is a baseline for an agent that uses Tensorflow and imitation with logs from simulation.

[This code is documented here](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/AIDO/outembodied_il_sim.html).
